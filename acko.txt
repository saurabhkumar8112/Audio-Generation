Some important resource i got
1. wavio, a very nice library for reading a wav file of any bit depth or of any sampling rate
2. natsort, for sorting in "logically correct" order rather than lexographically correct
3. AudioSegment for converting any mp3 file to wav, was difficult to debug, cause i missed some package while installing
